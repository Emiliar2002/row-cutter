# row-cutter
Short and simple photoshop script made to cut and paste a repeated element in multiple rows. In order to use it, you have to enter the size of the repeated element, the number of columns and rows and the script will start from the up-left corner of the canvas. If there is an empty space, try drawing over it, otherwise the cuts get weird.
